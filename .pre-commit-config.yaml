# pre-commit configuration
#
# We use pre-commit to enforce a consistent style in our repositories. The hooks
# check for a few common issues with files, and then execute the `+pre-commit`
# target in Earthly to run the same checks as the CI pipeline.
#
# See https://pre-commit.com for more information
# See https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html for more hooks
